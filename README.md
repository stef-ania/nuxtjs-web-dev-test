## Dependency Management

This project uses **pnpm** for managing dependencies. Ensure you have pnpm installed before running the project. You can install it globally using:

```bash
# pnpm
npm install -g pnpm
```

Alternatively, you can use npx for a temporary alias:

```bash
# pnpm
npx pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# pnpm
pnpm dev

# pnpm with temporary alias
npx pnpm run dev
```
